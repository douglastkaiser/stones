Master the art of building roads in this elegant abstract strategy game.

Stones is a deeply strategic board game where two players compete to connect opposite edges of the board with a continuous road of their pieces. Simple to learn but endlessly challenging to master, Stones offers the kind of strategic depth found in timeless classics like Chess and Go.

HOW TO PLAY

Place stones flat to build roads, or stand them upright to block your opponent. The capstone—your most powerful piece—can move stacks and flatten walls. Build a road connecting your two edges before your opponent does, or control the most territory when all pieces are played.
